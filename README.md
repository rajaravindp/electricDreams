## Comment
The project shines in its ability to create a comprehensive and robust pipeline, beginning with the extraction of data through meticulous web scraping, transitioning to secure storage in a PostgreSQL database, followed by insightful analytics performed using Python, and culminating in the development of an intuitive data visualization through Tableau. <br>
One of the key strengths of this project lies in its systematic approach to constructing the pipeline. It starts with the extraction of data, ensuring that the dataset is rich and representative of the market dynamics. The next step in the pipeline involves the secure storage of this data, which is achieved through the utilization of advanced persistence and optimization techniques, further orchestrated by Apache Airflow workflows. This guarantees the reliability and availability of the data for subsequent stages.
The analytics stage of the pipeline leverages the powerful capabilities of Python, specifically in the domains of statistical analysis and machine learning. This allows the project to create sophisticated models capable of predicting car prices accurately, which adds significant value to the insights generated. <br>
Lastly, the project excels in its data visualization capabilities, employing Tableau to create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard. This ensures that the insights derived from the data are easily comprehensible and actionable for stakeholders, thereby enhancing the utility of the project. <br>
However, the project does encounter a notable limitation in terms of real-time data updates. The absence of a CRON job, poses a challenge to achieving real-time data synchronization. <br>
To mitigate this challenge and further improve the system's capabilities, future iterations of the project will explore alternative solutions and strategies to implement real-time data updates. This could potentially involve the integration of additional tools and technologies, or the adoption of different approaches to data streaming and synchronization.
